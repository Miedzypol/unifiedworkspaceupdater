## Installation

You can install UWU by literally just downloading it from the releases page, and then extracting it. Yeah that's it. Make sure you have python3 installed and library  requests.

To setup the website, create a folder and then in it two things: `tree.txt` and `uwuupd` directory. `tree.txt` should contain ONLY files to update. You should upload files to the `uwuupd` directory.
## Run it!

Install the project (above this section), navigate via terminal to the place where you installed UWU. Then run:

```bash
python3 main.py start
```
This would start the program. It just downloads files from your website.
## Notice that...
...you shouldn't use it with big files. I mean images etc. It could potentially crash.
