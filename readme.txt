its a fucking UWU
UWU - Unified Workspace Updater version 11AT

first number - parent version
second - subversion
third - letter meaning subversion version
fourth - letter meaining subversion of version of subversion of parent version
idfk its complicated

just know that a - 1 b - 2 c - 3 etc..

note that in server.txt put the url WITHOUT THE "/". Program automatically adds it. And please put a tree.txt file on the server.
How the structure should work:

server:
- tree.json
- uwuupd:
-- files here...

tree.txt should be something like this:
'
main.py
readme.txt
shitprogramsoridk.cpp
# put your files and directories here
'
